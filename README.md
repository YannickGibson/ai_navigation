# 2D top-down driving through racetrack - simulation

* We will be using **AI** agent generation through NEAT (with the help of neat_python library); 


There is going to be generated X amount of cars, which are going to try to drive through the racetrack hopefully not backwards. After Y amount of time some % of cars will be reproduced and all of them will be destroyed, thats what we'll call a generation. There will be also an option to save the best genom to a file, which will be possible to be reused.
